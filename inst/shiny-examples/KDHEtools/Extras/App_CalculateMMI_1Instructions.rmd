1.  Load file
    -   Must be a comma-separated file (.csv)
    -   Choose file to upload. Hit the browse button and search for the input file.
    -   Once uploaded, make sure data look correct in the viewer.
2.  Exclude Taxa
    -   This required field will be added in automatically (unless you uncheck the box). Redundant (non-distinct) taxa are marked "TRUE", using the same <a href="https:://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blocktt/ShinyAppDocuments/main/KDHEtools/Reports/EXCLUDE_RedundantTaxa_DecisionCriteria.docx" target="_blank">criteria</a> that were used for MMI development. Redundant taxa are excluded from richness metric calculations but are included in the composition (percent individuals) metrics.
3.  Calculate Index
    -   Click the 'Calculate Metric Values and Scores' button.
    -   A progress bar will appear in the bottom, right corner of the screen. Results cannot be downloaded until the progress bar is completed and disappears.

    -   Check 'results_log.txt' for any warnings or messages. Note, some warnings are automatically generated by R. Feel free to reach out to Ben Block (Ben.Block@tetratech.com) for any questions related to warnings.
