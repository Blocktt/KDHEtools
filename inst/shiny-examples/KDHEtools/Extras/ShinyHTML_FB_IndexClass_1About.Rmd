# Purpose
The BCG calculator requires the inclusion of Index Name and Index Class fields 
in the input file (otherwise the R code won’t know which BCG rules to apply). 
These are not fields that users normally have in their data files, so we added 
this function to make that step easier.

## Index_Name
At this time, there is only one Index_Name option for the MaritimeNW model:
BCG_MariNW_Bugs500ct. This is set as the default. In the future, if there are 
refinements to version 1 of the BCG model, users will have the option of 
selecting version 1 or version 2 of the model.

## Index_Class
The MaritimeNW model has three classes based on elevation and gradient/slope:

*	low gradient/lower elevation (LoGrad-LoElev)

*	higher gradient/lower elevation (HiGrad-LoElev)

*	higher gradient/higher elevation (HiGrad-HiElev)

The classification thresholds are 1% for gradient and 750-m for elevation.

# Required Fields

*	SampleID or SiteID– unique identifier

    +	Tip: pick an identifier that can be linked to other files (such as the file 
coming out of the File Builder – Taxa Translator/Attribute function)

*	Gradient of the stream segment/flowline – units must be **percent** (0-100) 

*	Elevation – units must be **meters**

If you named the required fields differently in your input file, it’s ok. Click
on the drop-down menus. The list of fields in your input file will appear. 
Select the correct column headings.

IMPORTANT NOTE:

During BCG model development, we derived gradient and elevation information from
the following sources:

•	Gradient - NHDPlusV2 flowline slope (x 100) from the 
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/get-nhdplus-national-hydrography-dataset-plus-data" target = "_blank">NHDPlusV2</a> 
Attributes table (McKay et a. 2016)

•	Elevation - EPA 
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/streamcat-dataset" target = "_blank">EPA StreamCat</a>
elevation, local catchment scale (Hill et al. 2016)

When running the BCG model, we encourage you to use gradient and elevation data 
from the same sources that the BCG model was calibrated with. However, that is 
not a required and we know occasional situations will arise when it’s more 
appropriate to use other data sources. For example, if the stream is too small 
to show up in the NHDPlusV2 dataset but you can obtain flowline slope elsewhere,
do so (it is better than leaving it blank and not being able to generate a BCG 
model output). Another scenario you might encounter is that you have NHDPlusV2 
slope but you disagree with the slope class assignment (low vs high gradient). 
In those situations, investigate further. If you find that the NHDPlusV2 slope 
is not representative of the stream reach where the biological sampling took 
place, and you have a better, alternate source of slope for that site, use that 
instead.
