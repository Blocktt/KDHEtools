```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE
                      , results = 'asis'
                      , warning = FALSE
                      , message = FALSE)
```

A single zip file will be available for download.  It will include all result
files along the the original data file.  All result data files will be CSV 
format.

The zip file will included the base name of the original file along with the 
date and time.

The individual files will include the same basename along with a suffix to 
represent each step of the calculation process.

The entire criteria file is included to allow the user to check for non-matching
Index Name and/or criteria columns.

As an example if the input file was "xxx.csv" the result files will
look like those in the table below.

```{r}
# Packages
library(readxl)
library(knitr)

# Data
fn_data <- "OutputFileSubtabs.xlsx"
path_data <- file.path("tables", fn_data)
df_data <- read_excel(path_data, sheet = "FileBuild_IndexNameClass")

# Display
cap_data <- "File Builder, Assign Index_Class, zip file contents."
knitr::kable(df_data, "html", caption = cap_data)
```
