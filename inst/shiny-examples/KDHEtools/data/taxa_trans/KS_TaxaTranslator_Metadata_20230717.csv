TaxaID_orig,taxon name from the original source file
KS_TAXACODE,taxon code; provided by KDHE
Rank_orig,"level of taxonomic resolution (e.g., order, family, genus, species)"
NonTarget,TRUE = not appropriate to include in the KS MMI calculations. NonTarget taxa are excluded from all metric calculations
OTU_MMI,Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) for the KS MMI calculation. DNI (do not include) = taxon is not included in the MMI calculation
OTU_MMI_genus,Alternate OTU for the KS MMI calculation; differs from OTU_MMI in that species-level IDs are collapsed to genus or higher levels. DNI (do not include) = NonTarget.
OTU_BCG,OTU for the KS-Great Plains Biological Condition Gradient (BCG) models; currently the same as OTU_MMI
PHYLUM,taxonomic hierarchy based on the Taxon_orig field; provided by KDHE
CLASS,taxonomic hierarchy based on the Taxon_orig field; provided by KDHE
ORDER,taxonomic hierarchy based on the Taxon_orig field; provided by KDHE
FAMILY,taxonomic hierarchy based on the Taxon_orig field; provided by KDHE
GENUS,taxonomic hierarchy based on the Taxon_orig field; added by Tetra Tech
NumSamp_All,total number of samples the TaxaID_orig occurs in
NumSites_All,total number of unique sites the TaxaID_orig occurs at
Yr_Min,first year of occurrence in the KDHE dataset
Yr_Max,last year of occurrence in the KDHE dataset
NumSamp_SB,number of Stream Biological (SB) Monitoring Program samples the TaxaID_orig occurs in
NumSamp_SP,number of Stream Probabilistic (SP) program samples the TaxaID_orig occurs in
