TaxaID,"taxon name from the selected OTU (OTU_MMI, OTU_MMI_genus, OTU_BCG)"
Rank,"level of taxonomic resolution (e.g., order, family, genus, species)"
Slash,slashed OTU (/)
NonTarget,FALSE = target (ok to include in calculations). TRUE = nontarget (not appropriate to include in the KS MMI and BCG calculations)
BCG_sens,yes = included in the MMI; taxon is counted in the number of BCG attribute III+IV better taxa metric
Habit_CBCN,yes = included in the MMI; taxon is counted in the number of climber + clinger taxa metric
Order_EPT,yes = included in the MMI; taxon is counted in the number of EPT taxa metric
Volt_semi,yes = included in the MMI; taxon is counted in the number of semivoltine taxa metric
TolVal,"Tolerance to general disturbance, scaled from 0 (most intolerant) to 10 (most tolerant); Source: KS tolerance analysis (Tetra Tech 2023), Huggins and Moffett (1988), KBTOLR, Regional BCG"
BCG_Attr,"Biological Condition Gradient (BCG) taxa attribute assignments (2, 3, 4, 5, 6m). 2 = highly sensitive; 3 = sensitive ubiquitous; 4 = moderately tolerant; 5 = highly tolerant; 6 = nonnative, moderately tolerant"
BCG_Attr2,"BCG attribute subcategory: 4_better, 4_middle, 4_worse. ‘4_better’ are mostly habitat specialists that are not particularly sensitive to water quality, but appear to be sensitive to siltation/high% fines; ‘4_middle’ are taxa that occur everywhere; ‘4_worse’ are ubiquitous, but typically have higher abundance at poorer sites, such as those affected by nutrient enrichment or sedimentation"
FFG,"Primary Functional Feeding Group: collector-gatherer (CG), collector-filterer (CF), predator (PR), scraper (SC), shredder (SH), macrophyte herbivore (MH), omnivore (OM), parasite (PA), piercer-herbivore (PH), xylophage (XY). Multiple entries are allowed and are separated with a comma"

LIFE_CYCLE,"Number of broods or generations of an organism in a year (also referred to as 'voltinism'): univoltine (UNI), semivoltine (SEMI), or multivoltine (MULTI). Multiple entries are allowed and are separated with a comma"

THERMAL_INDICATOR,"Exploratory thermal preference assignment: cool or warm; based on results from a taxa tolerance analysis on the KDHE dataset (Tetra Tech 2023), using the modeled mean summer (July/August) stream temperature (MSST) metric (Hill et al. 2013) from USEPA’s StreamCat dataset (Hill et al. 2016)"
AirBreather,"TRUE = air breather, which include: Hemiptera (all families); Coleoptera - all adults other than Elmidae ande Dryopidae, and larvae of Dystiscidae, Hydrophilidae, Hydraenidae, Heteroceridae; Gyrinidae; Haliplidae; Scirtidae; Diptera (Culicidae larvae, Ptychopteridae larvae, Chaoboridae larvae (except Chaoborus sp.), Stratiomyidae, Dolichopodidae and Syrphidae"
