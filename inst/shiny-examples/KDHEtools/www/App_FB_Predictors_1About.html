<h1>Purpose</h1>
<p>Create a file with the predictor variablesfor the KS MMI calculation.
After you merge this file with the Taxa Translator/Add Attributes
output, your input file will be ready to run through the MMI
calculator.</p>
<p>Your input file must have the following four fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Unique identifier (e.g., SampleID) that can be joined with the
Taxa Translator/Add Attributes output</p></li>
<li><p>Latitude (decimal degrees)</p></li>
<li><p>Longitude (decimal degrees)</p></li>
<li><p>CFS (modeled median flow based on Perry et al. 2004)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The EPSG field (datum for coordinates) can be left blank (it will be
populated with the value 4269 (NAD83, North America) - <a href="https://epsg.io/4269" class="uri">https://epsg.io/4269</a>).</p>
<p>The underlying code in the Shiny app will use the lat/longs to match
the sites with NHDPlusV2 catchments and COMIDs (unique identifiers); the
<a href="https://github.com/Blocktt/KDHEtools/blob/main/inst/shiny-examples/KDHEtools/data/KS_StreamCat_PredictorTable_BenB_20230721.xlsx/" target="_blank">predictor
variables</a> are then joined to the input file via the COMID.</p>
<p>For more information about how the CFS field was derived for MMI
development, contact Liz Smith (Elizabeth.Smith@ks.gov).</p>

<h1>Disclaimers</h1>
<p>The StreamCat R tools that are used to match your sites with the
NHDPlusV2 stream segment identifiers (COMIDs) do not have QC measures.
At a minimum, we recommend the following check:</p>
<ul>
<li>Include waterbody name in your input file and check against
‘gnis_name’ in the output file (which is derived from the NHDPlusV2
dataset); if they don’t match, investigate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the size of your input file, this function may several
minutes to run (e.g., 5-10 minutes). Be patient. There is a lot going on
behind the scenes.</p>
