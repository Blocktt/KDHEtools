<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Why am I getting an error saying that I am missing columns even when
I am not?
<ul>
<li>You may have incorrectly spelled a given column. Also, some columns
(e.g., Index_Name) require an underscore to separate the two words.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Why does my data look strange in the data viewer?
<ul>
<li>You likely have the incorrect Separator or Quote selected.
Otherwise, there may be commas in text fields when the comma separator
is selected.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Index calculation is taking forever to calculate, has the app
frozen?
<ul>
<li>Even though R works remarkably fast, a large dataset will cause the
app to slow down. The estimate is approximately 30 seconds for small
datasets; however, this could extend to a few minutes for large
datasets.</li>
</ul></li>
