<p>This function allows the user to upload station information and
assigns natural StreamCat factors. Some metrics are adjusted based on
site-specific StreamCat estimates. <strong>See Background tab for metric
calculations.</strong> Note, the user must associate sites with NHDPlus
V2 COMIDs using GIS (outside of the app). There are over 75,000 unique
COMIDs in WY; however, there are approximately 50 COMIDs with some
missing StreamCat data. Regardless, any missing StreamCat data will
cause index scores to be incorrectly calculated. <strong>Site elevation
(ft)</strong> is also a metric adjustment factor, but must be provided
by the user. <strong>Finally, the downloaded metric adjustment factor
data will need to be merged with taxonomic data (outside of the app) to
properly calculate the index.</strong></p>
<p>Follow the steps to the left to upload a site and COMID table. For
more information on the derivation of these metric adjustment factors,
please read the <a href="https://github.com/Blocktt/ShinyAppDocuments/tree/main/WDEQtools/Reports">Wyoming
Diatom IBI report</a>. Feel free to download an <a href="https://github.com/Blocktt/ShinyAppDocuments/tree/main/WDEQtools/Example_Files">Example
