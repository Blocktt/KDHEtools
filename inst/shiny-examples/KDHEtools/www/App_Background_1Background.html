<h2>Background</h2>
<p>This R Shiny application (KDHEtools) calculates numeric Multi-Metric
Index (MMI) scores based on samples collected from wadeable streams in
Kansas (statewide). Five metrics are adjusted by 12-16 different factors
that represent natural stream types (see the <strong>“Metric Adjustment
Download”</strong> tab). A report detailing the development of the
Kansas Macroinvertebrate MMI can be found <a href="https://github.com/Blocktt/ShinyAppDocuments/tree/main/KDHEtools/Reports">here</a>.</p>

<p>Development of KDHEtools and the underlying MMI was funded by the
Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE).</p>

<h2>Intended application</h2>
<p>The purpose of the index is to describe the macroinvertebrate
community of Kansas freshwater streams and rivers for the purpose of
biological condition assessment. A macroinvertebrate IBI enhances the
state of Kansas’s monitoring and assessment strategy by adding a numeric
indicator of macroinvertebrate community structure that could be used
to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Evaluate attainment of Kansas’s narrative surface water quality
criteria protective of aquatic life for wadeable streams and rivers</li>
<li>Assist in identification of chemical and physical stressors to
aquatic life of wadeable streams and rivers in Kansas</li>
<li>Identify improvements in aquatic life of wadeable streams and rivers
in Kansas following restoration efforts.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Kansas Macroinvertebrate MMI is intended to be applied to samples
that meet the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Geographic area: Kansas</p></li>
<li><p>Stream type: freshwater, wadeable</p></li>
<li><p>Subsample size: 200-count samples are recommended for best
performance; once you get below 100, interpret with caution</p></li>
<li><p>Taxonomic resolution: genus or species-level as allowed by
available keys, specimen condition, and specimen maturity</p></li>
<li><p>Collection gear: 500-µm mesh D-frame net and fine point forceps •
Collection period: April 15–October 15</p></li>
<li><p>Collection method: KDHE Stream Probabilistic (<a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/1230/Stream-Probabilistic">SP</a>) program
or Stream Biological (<a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/1233/Stream-Biological-Monitoring-Program">SB</a>)
Monitoring Program protocols. Organisms are composited from multiple
habitats. Field staff try to maximize the diversity of organisms being
captured, targeting macrohabitats (riffles, leafpacks, undercut banks
and rootmats, fine substrate, aquatic vegetation, and large woody
debris). One or two-person field crews collect organisms with 500-µm
mesh D-frame nets, using sweeps or kicks, or by hand picking organisms
off large hard substrates. Organisms are picked in the field and
identified in the lab, going to genus or species-level as allowed by
available keys, specimen condition, and specimen maturity.</p></li>
</ul>

limits, see the Kansas Macroinvertebrate MMI development report <a href="https://github.com/Blocktt/ShinyAppDocuments/tree/main/KDHEtools/Reports">here</a>.</p>
