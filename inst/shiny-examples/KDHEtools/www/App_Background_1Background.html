<h2>Background</h2>
<p>This website calculates Multi-Metric Index (MMI) scores for benthic
macroinvertebrate samples collected from wadeable streams in Kansas. A
report detailing the development of the Kansas Macroinvertebrate MMI can
be found
<a href="https:://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blocktt/ShinyAppDocuments/main/KDHEtools/Reports/_KS_MMI_Report_20230810_v2.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>This is a Shiny app website. There is underlying R code that does the
MMI calculation. The user clicks buttons to upload .csv input files and
download results. Those who prefer to work directly with R can download
the R code from Ben Block’s GitHub repository
<a href="https://github.com/Blocktt/KDHEtools/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Funding</h2>
<p>Development of KDHEtools and the underlying MMI was funded by the
Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE). For more
information, please contact Tony Stahl (<a href="mailto:Anthony.Stahl@ks.gov" class="email">Anthony.Stahl@ks.gov</a>).</p>

<div id="intended-application" class="section level2">
<h2>Intended application</h2>
<p>The KS MMI improves the diagnostic ability of KDHE and other
practitioners to identify degradation in biological integrity and water
quality. It is intended to be applied to samples that meet the following
criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Geographic area: Kansas</p></li>
<li><p>Stream type: freshwater, wadeable</p></li>
<li><p>Subsample size: &gt;= 200-count samples are recommended for best
performance; results for samples with &lt;100 individuals should be
interpreted with caution</p></li>
<li><p>Taxonomic resolution: genus or species-level as allowed by
available keys, specimen condition, and specimen maturity</p></li>
<li><p>Collection gear: 500-µm mesh D-frame net and fine point forceps •
Collection period: April 15–October 15</p></li>
<li><p>Collection method: KDHE Stream Probabilistic
(<a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/1230/Stream-Probabilistic" target="_blank">SP</a>)
program or Stream Biological
(<a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/1233/Stream-Biological-Monitoring-Program" target="_blank">SB</a>)
Monitoring Program protocols. Organisms are composited from multiple
habitats. Field staff try to maximize the diversity of organisms being
captured, targeting macrohabitats (riffles, leafpacks, undercut banks
and rootmats, fine substrate, aquatic vegetation, and large woody
debris). One or two-person field crews collect organisms with 500-µm
mesh D-frame nets, using sweeps or kicks, or by hand picking organisms
off large hard substrates. Organisms are picked in the field and
identified in the lab.</p></li>
<li><p>Predictor variables: results for sites with predictor values
outside the range of values represented in the MMI reference calibration
dataset should be interpreted with caution. For more information, see
Table 13 in the MMI report.</p></li>
</ul>

limits, see the Kansas Macroinvertebrate MMI development report
